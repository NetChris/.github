# Hello and welcome to NetChris!

This "organization" is really just me, [Chris Simmons](https://github.com/ChrisSimmons).  "NetChris" is a name I came up many years ago when I thought I was going to establish a super awesome software business.  I never made that happen but I still have the name (and the `netchris.com` domain name).

Anyway, feel free to poke around.  Whatever source code I have made public here isn't really intended for public consumption but is still available for anyone to peruse.  As well, please feel free to open an issue on anything here.  I can't promise to respond right away.
